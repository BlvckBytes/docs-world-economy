In general, the likelihood of me accepting changes to the codebase itself are rather slim, so I'd advise you to ask ahead before starting to dive head-first into working on the project, just to be frustrated down the road. I'm comfortable with outsorcing simple fixes or minor behavioral adjustments, given that the overall project-style has been adhered to; architectural or algorithmic changes or introductions are most definitely to be discussed ahead of time.
